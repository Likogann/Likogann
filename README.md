<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Likogan</h1>

``NodeJS Developer``

I'm a NodeJS developer who specialised with RESTful APIs. I prefer using ExpressJS to handle my applications, but I'm more than willing to learn new platforms if they suit my needs better.

<h3 align="left">:black_nib: Specific Skills</h3>

- **:technologist: API Development**  
I spend most of my time programming working on APIs. See my github to learn more about my skills, and what I'm passionate about coding.

- **:keyboard: NodeJS**  
Coding primarily in NodeJS, I have a very strong grasp of how JavaScript works, both on the web, and on NodeJS.

- **:scroll: Docuemntation**  
I've used many platforms, like postman, to allow for a better understanding of an application for all developers. Any code I write is always littered with comments to allow anyone reading it to have an easy time developing a full grasp of what's going on under the hood

- **:floppy_disk: Servers & Production Environments**  
Having managed large production environments in the past, I know what I'm doing when it comes to servers. I have a very strong grasp on the Linux operating system, using it every day. I'm best using debian based systems, but can still get by pretty well on non-debian based systems.

- **:video_game: Game Servers**  
Having run Minecraft and Unturned servers since I was just ten years old, I have lots of experience managing a playerbase, and with developer tools. I've really enjoyed setting up things like NetworkManager, and other web-based administrator management portals.
